### Predicting sentiment from product reviews

The goal of this assignment is to explore **logistic regression** and **feature engineering** with existing *Turi Create* functions.

In this assignment, we will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative.

  - Use SFrames to do some feature engineering
  - Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.
  - Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.
  - Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.
  - Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the accuracy of the model.
  - Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.
  - Compare multiple logistic regression models.
