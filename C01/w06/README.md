### Deep features for image retrieval assignment

This assignment focuses on using deep learning to create nonlinear features to improve the performance of machine learning. We will see how transfer learning techniques are applied to use deep features learned with one dataset to get great performance on a different dataset. We will build models for image retrieval and image classification tasks.
