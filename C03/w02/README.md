### Implementing logistic regression from scratch

The goal of this assignment is to implement our own logistic regression classifier.

  - Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
  - Convert an SFrame into a NumPy array.
  - Implement the link function for logistic regression.
  - Write a function to compute the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to a single coefficient.
  - Implement gradient ascent.
  - Given a set of coefficients, predict sentiments.
  - Compute classification accuracy for the logistic regression model.


### Logistic Regression with L2 regularization

The goal of this assignment is to implement our own logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization.

  - Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
  - Convert an dataframe into a NumPy array.
  - Write a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function with an L2 penalty with respect to a single coefficient.
  - Implement gradient ascent with an L2 penalty.
  - Empirically explore how the L2 penalty can ameliorate overfitting.
