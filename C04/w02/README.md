### Choosing features and metrics for nearest neighbor search

When exploring a large set of documents -- such as Wikipedia, news articles, StackOverflow, etc. -- it can be useful to get a list of related material. 
To find relevant documents we typically
  - Decide on a notion of similarity
  - Find the documents that are most similar

In the assignment we will
  - Gain intuition for different notions of similarity and practice finding similar documents.
  - Explore the tradeoffs with representing documents using raw word counts and TF-IDF
  - Explore the behavior of different distance metrics by looking at the Wikipedia pages most similar to President Obamaâ€™s page.
