### Exploring precision and recall

The goal of this assignment is to understand precision-recall in the context of classifiers.

  - Use Amazon review data in its entirety.
  - Train a logistic regression model.
  - Explore various evaluation metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall.
  - Explore how various metrics can be combined to produce a cost of making an error.
  - Explore precision and recall curves.
