Clustering and retrieval are some of the most high-impact machine learning tools out there.
Retrieval is used in almost every applications and device we interact with, like in providing a set of products related to one a shopper is currently considering,
or a list of people you might want to connect with on a social media platform.
Clustering can be used to aid retrieval, but is a more broadly useful tool for automatically discovering structure in data, like uncovering groups of similar patients.
