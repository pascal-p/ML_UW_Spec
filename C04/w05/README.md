### Modeling text topics with Latent Dirichlet Allocation
In many cases, it is good to think of data as belonging to more than one cluster or category. For example, if we have a model for text data that includes both "Politics" and "World News" categories, then an article about a recent meeting of the United Nations should have membership in both categories rather than being forced into just one.

With this in mind, we will use Turi Create tools to fit an LDA model to a corpus of Wikipedia articles and examine the results to analyze the impact of a mixed membership approach.

In this assignment we will
  - apply standard preprocessing techniques on Wikipedia text data
  - use Turi Create to fit a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model
  - explore and interpret the results, including topic keywords and topic assignments for a document
