### Recommending songs
In this module, we focused on building recommender systems to find products, music and movies that interest users.  We also built an exciting Jupyter notebook for recommending songs, which we compared the simple popularity-based recommendation with a personalized model, and which showed the significant improvement provided by personalization.

In this assignment, we are going to explore the song data and the recommendations made by our model. In the process, we are going to learn how to use one of the most important data manipulation primitives: groupby.
