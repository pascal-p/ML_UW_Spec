### Predicting house prices
 cf. [Description](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/supplement/RP8te/predicting-house-prices-assignment)

In this module, we focused on using regression to predict a continuous value (house prices) from features of the house (square feet of living space, number of bedrooms,...).  We also built an Jupyter notebook for predicting house prices, using data from King County, USA, the region where the city of Seattle is located.

In this assignment, we are going to build a more accurate regression model for predicting house prices by including more features of the house.  In the process, we will also become more familiar with how the Python language can be used for data exploration, data transformations and machine learning.  These techniques will be key to building intelligent applications.
