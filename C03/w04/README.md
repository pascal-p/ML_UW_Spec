## C03w04: Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees

[Machine Learning(ML) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)
  - [ML Classification Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification/home/welcome)

### Decision Trees in Practice

In this assignment we will explore various techniques for preventing overfitting in decision trees.

We will extend the implementation of the binary decision trees that we implemented in the previous assignment.
We will use our solutions from the previous assignments and extend them.

  - Implement binary decision trees with different early stopping methods.
  - Compare models with different stopping parameters.
  - Visualize the concept of overfitting in decision trees.
