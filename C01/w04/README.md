### Retrieving Wikipedia articles

In this module, we focused on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text.  We explored two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF.  We also built an Jupyter notebook for retrieving articles from Wikipedia about famous people.

In this assignment, we are going to dig deeper into this application, explore the retrieval results for various famous people, and familiarize ourselves with the code needed to build a retrieval system.
