  - [ML Classification Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification/home/welcome)

### Exploring Ensemble Methods

In this homework we will explore the use of boosting. For this assignment, we will use the pre-implemented gradient boosted trees in Turi-Create.

  - Use SFrames to do some feature engineering.
  - Train a boosted ensemble of decision-trees (gradient boosted trees) on the lending club dataset.
  - Predict whether a loan will default along with prediction probabilities (on a validation set).
  - Evaluate the trained model and compare it with a baseline.
  - Find the most positive and negative loans using the learned model.
  - Explore how the number of trees influences classification performance.


### Boosting a decision stump

In this homework we will implement our own boosting module.

  - Train a boosted ensemble of decision-trees (gradient boosted trees) on the lending club dataset.
  - Predict whether a loan will default along with prediction probabilities (on a validation set).
  - Evaluate the trained model and compare it with a baseline.
  - Find the most positive and negative loans using the learned model.
  - Explore how the number of trees influences classification performance.Implementing binary decision trees
